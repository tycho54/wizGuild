Notes for mages guild

2015/07/22	Met with graeme, hashed out some initial ideas.  Want a game similar to 
			God save the queen, but with more freedom of things to do.  Each month
			you'll need to set how you're dividing your time between various tasks, 
			but rather than picking two from a list of many, you'll set values on
			a few sliders (eg, study, socialize, relax, spy, etc.), which will 
			impact your stats.  After each slider-setting, there will be an event, 
			which will give some text describing the event, then a list of options
			to select from.  The event itself, and the options within it will depend
			on the game state (stats and flags that can be set in other events), and
			will impact the game state.  
			
			My initial task is to get a prototype of that loop up and running, so that
			we can tweak it from there.  Graeme will do some writing of the first year
			or so of game time so we can see how the two match up.  given ourselves 
			two weeks to complete these initial tasks.  
			
			Objects needed: 
				mages (both the player, and the class mates), which will have stats
						and flags.  NPCs will have personality traits as well, but
						which will basically just be NPC-only flags.  
				Events, which will have text, options, and consequences.  Will probably
						also have to have pre-reqs for occuring too.
				Display object, which will show the two screen types (sliders and 
						events)
				Main function, which will keep track of time steps, game state, and
						repeatedly call the display object's functions, and alternate
						between the two screens.  ie, it'll do all the work.  it is 
						the model part of the model-control-display triad. 
				stats, which are just associative arrays, but making them objects
						will make it easier to change what stats mages can have.
				flags, just a plain old list of strings probably, with a function to
						check if it contains a value.  Again may be too simple to 
						justify its own class, but probably will be useful to make
						it one, as it'll be easier to expand than if we hard code it
						as an array.  
				Calendar?	not sure if this is necessary.  Could just do "month 43" 
						or whatever, but probably nicer to have an IC calendar instead.
				Guild	is a list of mages, and possibly their views of one another?  
						May also include norms/rules that the guild enforces, and the
						consequences of violating them.  
				Rules	a list of things you can't do, and the consequences for violating
						them.  Will be part of the guild object, and will need to be checked
						after/during each event.  
				
			Also need to figure out something that will let Graeme enter events into the game
			without me having to cut-and-paste his stuff into the code.  So may need to write
			a little engine that lets him do that.  Need to think a bit more about how to
			handle that best (since we'll be working on different computers).  
			
			Also need to think about the guts of the engine.  How will events be selected
			each month?  Will be list of all events, which will need to get filtered down
			to only those that are possible given the state, and then one of them selected.
			Will each possible event be equally likely, or will some be more likely than
			others?  Also, how do NPCs advance each month?  They'll presumably select their
			actions each month as well based on some formula (with random component?) that
			will update their stats.  Will they have events too?  Or will the PC's events 
			cover what, if anything, the NPCs do beyond their slider selection?  

2015/07/28	started coding things up, using G's first-6-turns right up as a guide.  Reached
			a question point about flags, and what should be included with what objects.  
			Does "A likes B" go with A, B, both, or some container object that holds them both?
			Do stat-altering objects just up the stat directly, or only apply when "used"? (and
			if the latter, when/how are they used?)  How best to keep effects of flags defined
			on themselves, but applied at the right phase of the game?  Going to move onto the
			gui part and let those questions percolate a bit...
			
			need one object(so a class) for the game state, and another for the gui.  The
			gui part will contain sub-windows, so probably want a class for each of those
			as well, with methods in the gui object for displaying each when called.  the 
			main function will interact with both the gui and the game state, updating
			each by sending message when appropriate.  
			
			right now the gui has hard-coded width/height, and behaves oddly when resized.
			when we get further, i need to make it be able to handle things better.
			
			Note: remembered that I can make the main code hold game logic by putting 
			methods in there that can be called without an instance of the class (static?),
			so can hold the game state there, and talk to the gui and game state using 
			methods in the class that holds the main function.
			
			TODO wednesday:  create a dummy character with some stats, and make them display
			in the character window.  fill in the gameState class with attributes so that
			I can get the main window of the gui looping through stages (don't worry about
			doing stuff in each stage just yet; fine to just show a place-holder message
			for now).  create a class for events. 
			
2015/07/29	Starting up today working on the TODO list from yesterday...
			-added temp image of wizard to player info section of screen
			-added some dummy stats and looped over them to display in the character half of screen
			-created functionality to redraw the main gui frame for each phase of the game.
				currently just has a message saying what the phase will do, and has a done button
				to move to the next phase.  next step is to start populating these phases.  the first
				one is the "slider" screen.  ideally want to write a function that creates this given
				a list of options, rather than hard-coding it in.  the last two screens will be for
				events, and I'll need to make a new class for those next week.
				
2015/08/03	back at it again.  will meet up with G tomorrow pm, so ideally will get the slider screen
			done today.  can use a private class for the sub-sections of the slider page, since they're
			not going to be re-usable elsewhere.  will have an int and a text box within the main
			class for showing the remaining ("relax") time left to be distributed.  The subsections
			will extend jpanel, and have an int value, two buttons (+ and -), and a textbox/label which
			displays the value.  When the buttons are pushed, it will increase the local value, and 
			decrease the parent's relax value.  buttons should become non-functional when at max/min
			possible.  finally, their will be a done button in the corner which should submit the 
			values to the gamestate for updating.  
				-have created the private class for the mini guis, and all seems to be working as desired
					(except buttons don't /appear/ disabled when at max/min values; they don't do anything
					but you can still click on them.  may want to change this)
			TODO:  Tomorrow I need to get the event class written and implemented, to be able to show
			how the last two phases will look/work.  doesn't need to do much for now, but needs to work
			as a demonstration of the concept.  
			
2015/08/04	just the morning to work on things today, as meeting graeme at 1pm to discuss progress.  need
			to get an event class up and running to demonstrate how things will work.  Should be okay to
			use same class for both special events and the normal, random ones, and just have them selected
			in different manners.  
			-ran into trouble early, because would like to use methods as parameters for constructor of
				event objects, but not possible in java.  one option is to upgrade to java 8, which has
				lambda objects, but not sure that will actually fix what i'm trying to do, also would
				be a bit of a hassle.  another option is to do similar to what i did in chieftain, and
				create a code system for conditions and consequences.  this will be fairly messy and 
				error prone.  Another possible option is to use the work-around of action listeners
				as methods?  will need to look into if this is possible...wouldn't necessarily solve the
				issue, because wouldn't handle the conditional part (ie, would wait for some event to
				occur before running the code to check them).  So seems like internal coding/decoding
				system it will have to be...No!  looked at lambda's more, and that's really what I should
				be using here, and will be good for me to learn.  won't be able to get them up and running
				by this afternoon, though (will need to upgrade to java 8, get eclipse on board, and may
				have to copy the files over to a new project once i do...lots of possible snags in there),
				so for this afternoon get a dummy run going without conditionals and consequences, just
				to get a demo.  then next week get java 8 installed, and redo with lambdas
				
2015/08/10	Back at it for another (two day) week!  installed java 8 last night, and tried setting eclipse
			up to use it this morning.  not sure yet if it worked...so need to write my first lambda and 
			see what happens!
				-first attempt (using a lambda with an actionlistoner, doesn't seem to have worked...
					-changed from 7 to 8 in a few sections, but still looks like it only sees at 7 
						compiler (looking at project->properties->java compiler) 				
					-downloaded the newest version of eclipse, seems to have worked so far, but
						still have errors in my lambda...(reverted to old version of file, and it
						seemed to have worked fine, so at least haven't lost any ground yet...)
				-tried a simple 'helloworld' example of a lambda from online, and it worked, so java
					and eclipse are working fine.  still haven't got it handling my actionListener
					as I want it to, but the fiddly bit should be over now!
				-fixed it!  so all is working as expected/desired now!  Huzzah!
				-coded up Event class using lambdas.
			todo tomorrow:  get the rules class up and running, and create some sample mages, events
				within it to test out the functionality, and that all running.  then work on getting
				the gui looking nicer (perhaps with that MIGlayout thing).  check notes in my kindle
				to make sure i didn't forget anything.  also put character traits/properties for
				mages into the rules class.  

2015/08/11	Going to start the day creating the rules class to hold game-specific stuff, and put 
			in it a few examples of the classes (mage, event for now) to play around with and
			test functionality.  
			--removed the Mage class and replaced it with Character class, which seems a bit more
				general (especially if the idea is to make all the setting-specific stuff be held
				in the rulesSet).  
			--add a gender pronoun enum thing to the character class, so when writing events it will
				be easy to get the character's gender without having to know the character beforehand.
			--changed all the stuff in the existing gui code to use characters instead of mages
			--created a rulesset class, with a sample character and event
			--had to make some changes to the gui logic to make the character info page update when
				the other panel had done something to change it.  now repaints the character info
				panel each time it repaints the main panel.  looks a bit wonky now (size issues)
				but can deal with that next week.  but it now updates the character info based on
				the lambda in the sample event	
			
2015/08/17	
			--added a back button to phase 2
			--looked into miglayout
			
2015/08/18	today need to get miglayout working.  if that goes smoothly, put a menubar in as well
			--downloaded the jar, put it in the eclipse all folder, and added it to the build path
			--used ctrl-shift-o to find the proper include, and all seems to be working fine now.
				have replaced all the references to gbc in the main gui panel, but will need to
				do the actual formatting now and get it to look nice(ish).  will probably take some
				degree of fiddling...
			--making decent progress with the layout.  is pretty intuitive.  need to figure out 
				how to send it multiple commands at same time (eg, span 2 and wrap), but otherwise
				is working nicely. 
				--to supply multiple commands, just separate them with commas.  nice and easy!
			--gui is more or less updated for MigLayout.  still have the issue of setting the 
				preferred sizes of things, and how I want to handle that, but am leaving as is for 
				now, so can work on putting in a menu bar.
			--menu bar added, but only with "test" menu items and currently no functionality.  will
				need to ask Graeme what values he wants all of these to take.  
				
			for next week:  need to put more into the rule set (player info etc) from Graeme's notes,
				and get the 2nd random event page working like the first.  try implementing some of
				graeme's example events using my classes, and make sure it's doable.  
				can also improve the menu, by making the items actually do something.  
				also look at TODOs in the code for more options			


2015/08/25	a few quick moments in norway...
			colored the non-selectable options in the event phase a different color (needs to be
				changed to something else when i can check what the number means)
			need to change the "phase" system to a "turn type" system...gui shouldn't be hard-coded
				based on the phase, but instead on whether its an event, slider, event-selector, or
				whatever phase.  gamestate should tell it which to display.  
			need to make the stuff all come from rules set, rather than from the gui/gamestate
			ideally should change "time" to "expendable resource" or whatever, so that we're i
				working in the most generic setting outside the ruleset.  in some other game
				it may not be time that they spend each round (and may not spend it each round,
				either! may be that's the level-up part, and most of the game is actually events!)
				
2015/08/27	more norway coding
			changed the displayPhase methods in the main gui to make it a bit more versatile, and
				to make use of the rulesSet methods (ie, now isn't hardcoded to be 4 phases in 
				a row. it asks the rulesSet to tell it what phase to show next, based on the 
				game state)
			moved several methods over to the rulesSet from the game state
			moved miniGui to its own class, rather than a private class in the main gui
			created a function in the rulesset for determining the activities to use
				in the spending phase.  need to change the gui phase to have selectable guis
				that have limited number of options (ie, can only study two magicks at a time)
				but need to do a bit of googling to figure out how to do drop downs

2015/08/31	norway coding 3: at the hotel, so have internet access, so will try to get
				the drop box selectors working as desired, and change the color of 
				the unselectable options 
			--changed the color of unselectable event options to red
			--added combo boxes to spend phase.  still haven't linked them to
				prevent you from doing the same thing twice
				--combo boxes now work like they should, but need to fix the way they are 
					initialized so that repeat options aren't there to cause problems...
					--FIXED!  was rather fiddly, and code is a bit ugly.  probably a ripe for
						improvement at some later point.  but is functional for now.  
				
2015/09/07	back home and working on the game again.  Met with G last week to discuss next steps, and
			top task for me was to get the slider page functioning/doing stuff with the player stats.
			Idea is to just try something for now, and iterate as needed.  So have started putting
			logic into the rulesset function to deal with this... 		
			--have worked just on getting aeromancy working, as an example case.  written a pair
				of methods for implementing a logit model for skill advancement, but need to
				play around with the parameters a bit more to get it balanced as desired.
			tomorrow: generalize the code a bit better, so I don't have to do every skill/magic
				by hand.  have it check to see if you've learned the spell once you reach a
				certain level in skill for magics.
				
2015/09/08	today want to expand on what i did yesterday with the time phase, and get all the 
			current activities handled appropriately.
			--got the stress system working (goes up as square of 'overtime' hours, but reduces
				only linearly, so will mostly want to avoid using it, except in a time crunch
			--all spells handled in same way currently, not sure if this is good or not...
				do we want different schools to behave differently, or all the same?
			--skills currently set up to work same as spells.  again, do we want to make them
				different?
			--jobs currently set up so that each just gives you gold equal to number of hours spent.
				will need to update that to include the specifics of each job.
			--interact:socialize currently not doing anything, as that seems to deal with NPCs, so 
				will likely be trickier to do.
			--moved the submit results call to after the second phase; now back button doesn't
				let them get infinite time
			Probably need to set up the time-costing actions a bit differently, with each type
				having it's own class perhaps?  And the one of the elements of the class being
				a lambda which indicates how to handle time being spent on that action.  Then
				can put all the magic schools, jobs, etc. into an array, and have the code
				grab that array and decide what to do with it, rather than it being hard coded
				into the gui as it is now.  Each of these will also have to have a lambda indicating
				whether or not it is an available action.  Could also put a "max time" attribute,
				so that they don't each have to have the same max time that can be spent on
				them.  
			also want the time spending page to display estimates of the change in stats that
				are likely to occur due to the time spent.  can use same function used to compute
				the change in stats to do this (but will want to use 2 decimal places, most likely?)	
				
2015/09/14	only one day to work on this this week (will get 3 next week).  
				--created a timeSpendOption class, to hold the various schools and skills and such
					that you can spend time on in the time spend phase.  uses lambdas, so is nice
					and generic/abstract.  need to put the actual instances in the rulesSet, but
					original plan was to have ruleSet be purely abstract and not need an implementation.
					Thinking now that I should make an instance of it, and put the instances of
					the timeSpendOptions into that instance on instantiation.  Will need to create
					the instance in main.  
				--doing a whole lot of breaking of the other classes to get them to use the new
					TimeSpendOption class.  May take me a while to things working nicely again...
				--getting things back to how they should be still need to make button to add more
					mini guis of same type, and link them together.  
				--have added an arraylist to game state to hold functions which get called after
					time is spent.  this is so that options not selected in any combobox can
					be referenced (e.g., if an event wants to check if you ever spend less than X
					time on a task, but then you don't pick that task in the combo box, you can't
					put the check in the spendtime function for that activity, because that's only
					called if they spend time on it.  instead, put the check into the function list,
					which gets called after all time is spent).  basically, if you need to do something
					after the time spend phase, make it a function and add it to the array in 
					gameState.  note, each function has a name, which can be used to remove it
					from the list, but doing so within the loop may cause problems, so may want to
					handle that differently? (note, can just overwrite the function with same name
					but empty function?)
					
				for next week:
					--get the mini gui's working as desired if I haven't finished that today
						--needs to only expand if less than 5(?) already there, and if there
							are enough options to fill it up
						--also need to make sure the submit activties and times gets all the 
							miniGuis (including ones created with teh > button)
					--get all the timeOptions filled in in the RulesSets, with functions that
						actually do something (ie, implement the trainining)
						--note, make use of the training times functions I've added that now
							take parameters so different things train a different rates
						--make sure at least some of the items make use of the predicate function,
							and put something in it to test it (eg, lore > 10 before you can
							train necromancy)
					--read G's docs and make sure I've got everything up to date for the stuff
						I'm working on
						
2015/09/21	had some ideas on how to get the guis working.  need to add some state that keeps track
			of the previous item selected, then add that to all other guis, and remove the current
			one when this one makes a selection change.  will work on the list above today, and see
			how far i get.
				-- think i've got the mini guis working properly now (split button, at least, 
					haven't done anything with submitting
				--	have started implementing affects of time spent.  made a wrapper for studying
					to avoid a lot of repeated code.  now need to type in all the stuff G has 
					come up with so far.
				-- 	added all the spell types, skills,  and jobs in G's list to the things 
					you can spend time on each month.  all things of each type currently set
					to do basically the same thing: either give you money equal to time worked,
					or improve the relevant skill/magic by a given s curve.  necromancy also
					causes stress at the moment. 
			Now need to figure out what is the next important thing to work on.  Probably need G 
			provide some insight into what numbers should go into the various time spend options, 
			so can put that aside for a while.  

2015/09/24	today the task is to learn github and get my files onto it.
			--signed up for account.  is £7/month to have private repositories, which i'm willing
				to pay for at this point, since don't want all my stuff public
			--installed the app on computer
			--created a repository on the webpage, and cloned it to the mage guild directory
				(note, just under the work space, so doesn't actually include all my files)
			--copy/pasted my files into the repository on my computer
			--after changes to files, copy them to the repository (note, i'm just copying the src
				file from teh workspace into the git folder for now.  probably want to copy the 
				whole thing over and declare a new workspace or something), then open the app.
				find the repository (mage-guild) on left, will say X uncomitted changes at top.
				click on that, and it should give you a chance to fill in some messages to describe
				the changes.  that gets it ready LOCALLY, but still need to send it to server!
				clikc sync in top right to this...
			--seems to be working like it should, though i can't claim to fully understand it...								

2015/12/12	first day back after harddrive crash and getting lappy fixed.  trying to get git
			working as i'd like.  had to create a new ssh key for the harddrive, since
			lost the old one in the crash (google git creating ssh public key).
			(note, pw id normal long)
			-on github page created a new branch in mage-guild called 'after-crash'
			-navigated into to /src folder of mage guild workspace (is several folders down)
			  right clicked and did a git bash here
			-in the git bash window did git init (this creates a .git folder)
			-git add .   to tell it to track all the files here
			-git commit -m "first commit"   (saves the tracked files, -m attaches message)
			-git clone https://github.com/tycho54/mage-guild.git (links local git to my repo)
			-git remote add origin git@github.com:tycho54/mage-guild.git  (so it knows where 
					to send stuff
			-tried git push origin master, but got an error, b/c missing stuff that's
			 		already in master.
			-git pull   (to grab any files from github it was expecting ot be there)
			-git add . , git commit -m  (to bring it all back up to date)
			-did git push -f origin master (-f is force, which overrides all that other
				stuff that was causing problems)
				
			-moved this file (notes) inside the repository, so it gets saved as well, and 
				did git add notes, git status, git commit -m "added notes", git push origin master
			-git branch working (to create a new branch), git push origin working (to
				make a working branch to keep master safer--use this for now, but can
				merge into master when im happy with the changes)
			
			-next up:  need to put miglayout back into place!	
				-downloaded the jar file
				-right clicked mage guild project (top folder on left)
				-picked buildpath -> add external archive, and pointed it to the file
				all seems to be working fine now.
				
			-now on to getting the magic types put into the rules set...
				-UFF DA!! running into major problems, eclipse not seeing the updated
					files, and instead runs old versions from i-dont-know-where.
				-created a new work space, made new project, copied files over,
					and now things seem to work.  will need to set everything
					back up again for git...
					--right clicked on mage guild (project level) in directory,
						and clicked git bash here
					--git init
					--git add .
					--git commit -m "after copied to new workspace"
					--went to github, created new private repository, called wizGuild
					--git remote add origin git@github.com:tycho54/wizGuild.git
					--git push origin master
					--git branch working
					--git push origin working
					seems like all is okay now.
				
			--Okay, on to magic types for real now!
				--re-rewrote the skills update code to only use a scale, not
					a scale and an offset--since we want skills to start at
					1 effectively (0 would be better, but causes blow ups), 
					offset was determined by the scale.  now only a one parameter
					model, which is nicer.  also hard-coded max value to 100.
				--put in a stress increase for aeromancy based on G's numbers, 
					but will cause way too much as is, so will need to reduce
					significantly
				--put in a chance to learn a magic based on skill level, but may
					be way too hard to learn in current state.  will need to
					check with graeme about what his numbers mean
			
2015/10/13		starting this morning on getting the stress and learn-times
					put into the game.  talked w/ g last night re: stress scores,
					and he basically said to just use the numbers as guides, and
					use my judgement, so can make it up, basically.  also, wants
					learn times to be as stated, +/- about 10.  difficulty can
					be ignored for now.  
				--all magics are now in the system for learning time and stress, 
					following G's notes as guidelines
				--made stress reduce your chance of learning a new magic by the 
					current value (e.g., if you had 50% chance of learning it, 
					and 10 stress, you'd drop to 40% chance)
				--also made stress reduce effective time spent studying by 1/10 
					of the current stress levels (which means stress has bigger
					impact if you're trying to do lots of different things, which
					seems appropriate) (note, only has effect if stress >10,
					because using floor).
				--put a vertical scroll bar on the skill list of the player
					info panel.  will need to separate the items into reasonable
					groups at some point (skills, magics, attributes, etc).
				--fixed a bug where the main panel wasn't resizing properly when
					adding a new mini gui
					
					
			
				
				
ISSUES:		-Need to settle on a screen size/resolution and/or sort out how to make it resize
				as we want it to.
			-NPCs and all the world other than the PC
			-time-free actions (check out book, trade, etc)
			-extra info pages and menu bar options
			-servants (golems, imps, etc.)
			-item creation and use
			-Event creator GUI for G to use
			-spell combat?
			-system for determining which "random" events occur each month
