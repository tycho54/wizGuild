Notes for mages guild

2015/07/22	Met with graeme, hashed out some initial ideas.  Want a game similar to 
			God save the queen, but with more freedom of things to do.  Each month
			you'll need to set how you're dividing your time between various tasks, 
			but rather than picking two from a list of many, you'll set values on
			a few sliders (eg, study, socialize, relax, spy, etc.), which will 
			impact your stats.  After each slider-setting, there will be an event, 
			which will give some text describing the event, then a list of options
			to select from.  The event itself, and the options within it will depend
			on the game state (stats and flags that can be set in other events), and
			will impact the game state.  
			
			My initial task is to get a prototype of that loop up and running, so that
			we can tweak it from there.  Graeme will do some writing of the first year
			or so of game time so we can see how the two match up.  given ourselves 
			two weeks to complete these initial tasks.  
			
			Objects needed: 
				mages (both the player, and the class mates), which will have stats
						and flags.  NPCs will have personality traits as well, but
						which will basically just be NPC-only flags.  
				Events, which will have text, options, and consequences.  Will probably
						also have to have pre-reqs for occuring too.
				Display object, which will show the two screen types (sliders and 
						events)
				Main function, which will keep track of time steps, game state, and
						repeatedly call the display object's functions, and alternate
						between the two screens.  ie, it'll do all the work.  it is 
						the model part of the model-control-display triad. 
				stats, which are just associative arrays, but making them objects
						will make it easier to change what stats mages can have.
				flags, just a plain old list of strings probably, with a function to
						check if it contains a value.  Again may be too simple to 
						justify its own class, but probably will be useful to make
						it one, as it'll be easier to expand than if we hard code it
						as an array.  
				Calendar?	not sure if this is necessary.  Could just do "month 43" 
						or whatever, but probably nicer to have an IC calendar instead.
				Guild	is a list of mages, and possibly their views of one another?  
						May also include norms/rules that the guild enforces, and the
						consequences of violating them.  
				Rules	a list of things you can't do, and the consequences for violating
						them.  Will be part of the guild object, and will need to be checked
						after/during each event.  
				
			Also need to figure out something that will let Graeme enter events into the game
			without me having to cut-and-paste his stuff into the code.  So may need to write
			a little engine that lets him do that.  Need to think a bit more about how to
			handle that best (since we'll be working on different computers).  
			
			Also need to think about the guts of the engine.  How will events be selected
			each month?  Will be list of all events, which will need to get filtered down
			to only those that are possible given the state, and then one of them selected.
			Will each possible event be equally likely, or will some be more likely than
			others?  Also, how do NPCs advance each month?  They'll presumably select their
			actions each month as well based on some formula (with random component?) that
			will update their stats.  Will they have events too?  Or will the PC's events 
			cover what, if anything, the NPCs do beyond their slider selection?  

2015/07/28	started coding things up, using G's first-6-turns right up as a guide.  Reached
			a question point about flags, and what should be included with what objects.  
			Does "A likes B" go with A, B, both, or some container object that holds them both?
			Do stat-altering objects just up the stat directly, or only apply when "used"? (and
			if the latter, when/how are they used?)  How best to keep effects of flags defined
			on themselves, but applied at the right phase of the game?  Going to move onto the
			gui part and let those questions percolate a bit...
			
			need one object(so a class) for the game state, and another for the gui.  The
			gui part will contain sub-windows, so probably want a class for each of those
			as well, with methods in the gui object for displaying each when called.  the 
			main function will interact with both the gui and the game state, updating
			each by sending message when appropriate.  
			
			right now the gui has hard-coded width/height, and behaves oddly when resized.
			when we get further, i need to make it be able to handle things better.
			
			Note: remembered that I can make the main code hold game logic by putting 
			methods in there that can be called without an instance of the class (static?),
			so can hold the game state there, and talk to the gui and game state using 
			methods in the class that holds the main function.
			
			TODO wednesday:  create a dummy character with some stats, and make them display
			in the character window.  fill in the gameState class with attributes so that
			I can get the main window of the gui looping through stages (don't worry about
			doing stuff in each stage just yet; fine to just show a place-holder message
			for now).  create a class for events. 
			
2015/07/29	Starting up today working on the TODO list from yesterday...
			-added temp image of wizard to player info section of screen
			-added some dummy stats and looped over them to display in the character half of screen
			-created functionality to redraw the main gui frame for each phase of the game.
				currently just has a message saying what the phase will do, and has a done button
				to move to the next phase.  next step is to start populating these phases.  the first
				one is the "slider" screen.  ideally want to write a function that creates this given
				a list of options, rather than hard-coding it in.  the last two screens will be for
				events, and I'll need to make a new class for those next week.
				
2015/08/03	back at it again.  will meet up with G tomorrow pm, so ideally will get the slider screen
			done today.  can use a private class for the sub-sections of the slider page, since they're
			not going to be re-usable elsewhere.  will have an int and a text box within the main
			class for showing the remaining ("relax") time left to be distributed.  The subsections
			will extend jpanel, and have an int value, two buttons (+ and -), and a textbox/label which
			displays the value.  When the buttons are pushed, it will increase the local value, and 
			decrease the parent's relax value.  buttons should become non-functional when at max/min
			possible.  finally, their will be a done button in the corner which should submit the 
			values to the gamestate for updating.  
				-have created the private class for the mini guis, and all seems to be working as desired
					(except buttons don't /appear/ disabled when at max/min values; they don't do anything
					but you can still click on them.  may want to change this)
			TODO:  Tomorrow I need to get the event class written and implemented, to be able to show
			how the last two phases will look/work.  doesn't need to do much for now, but needs to work
			as a demonstration of the concept.  
			
2015/08/04	just the morning to work on things today, as meeting graeme at 1pm to discuss progress.  need
			to get an event class up and running to demonstrate how things will work.  Should be okay to
			use same class for both special events and the normal, random ones, and just have them selected
			in different manners.  
			-ran into trouble early, because would like to use methods as parameters for constructor of
				event objects, but not possible in java.  one option is to upgrade to java 8, which has
				lambda objects, but not sure that will actually fix what i'm trying to do, also would
				be a bit of a hassle.  another option is to do similar to what i did in chieftain, and
				create a code system for conditions and consequences.  this will be fairly messy and 
				error prone.  Another possible option is to use the work-around of action listeners
				as methods?  will need to look into if this is possible...wouldn't necessarily solve the
				issue, because wouldn't handle the conditional part (ie, would wait for some event to
				occur before running the code to check them).  So seems like internal coding/decoding
				system it will have to be...No!  looked at lambda's more, and that's really what I should
				be using here, and will be good for me to learn.  won't be able to get them up and running
				by this afternoon, though (will need to upgrade to java 8, get eclipse on board, and may
				have to copy the files over to a new project once i do...lots of possible snags in there),
				so for this afternoon get a dummy run going without conditionals and consequences, just
				to get a demo.  then next week get java 8 installed, and redo with lambdas
				
2015/08/10	Back at it for another (two day) week!  installed java 8 last night, and tried setting eclipse
			up to use it this morning.  not sure yet if it worked...so need to write my first lambda and 
			see what happens!
				-first attempt (using a lambda with an actionlistoner, doesn't seem to have worked...
					-changed from 7 to 8 in a few sections, but still looks like it only sees at 7 
						compiler (looking at project->properties->java compiler) 				
					-downloaded the newest version of eclipse, seems to have worked so far, but
						still have errors in my lambda...(reverted to old version of file, and it
						seemed to have worked fine, so at least haven't lost any ground yet...)
				-tried a simple 'helloworld' example of a lambda from online, and it worked, so java
					and eclipse are working fine.  still haven't got it handling my actionListener
					as I want it to, but the fiddly bit should be over now!
				-fixed it!  so all is working as expected/desired now!  Huzzah!
				-coded up Event class using lambdas.
			todo tomorrow:  get the rules class up and running, and create some sample mages, events
				within it to test out the functionality, and that all running.  then work on getting
				the gui looking nicer (perhaps with that MIGlayout thing).  check notes in my kindle
				to make sure i didn't forget anything.  also put character traits/properties for
				mages into the rules class.  

2015/08/11	Going to start the day creating the rules class to hold game-specific stuff, and put 
			in it a few examples of the classes (mage, event for now) to play around with and
			test functionality.  
			--removed the Mage class and replaced it with Character class, which seems a bit more
				general (especially if the idea is to make all the setting-specific stuff be held
				in the rulesSet).  
			--add a gender pronoun enum thing to the character class, so when writing events it will
				be easy to get the character's gender without having to know the character beforehand.
			--changed all the stuff in the existing gui code to use characters instead of mages
			--created a rulesset class, with a sample character and event
			--had to make some changes to the gui logic to make the character info page update when
				the other panel had done something to change it.  now repaints the character info
				panel each time it repaints the main panel.  looks a bit wonky now (size issues)
				but can deal with that next week.  but it now updates the character info based on
				the lambda in the sample event	
			
2015/08/17	
			--added a back button to phase 2
			--looked into miglayout
			
2015/08/18	today need to get miglayout working.  if that goes smoothly, put a menubar in as well
			--downloaded the jar, put it in the eclipse all folder, and added it to the build path
			--used ctrl-shift-o to find the proper include, and all seems to be working fine now.
				have replaced all the references to gbc in the main gui panel, but will need to
				do the actual formatting now and get it to look nice(ish).  will probably take some
				degree of fiddling...
			--making decent progress with the layout.  is pretty intuitive.  need to figure out 
				how to send it multiple commands at same time (eg, span 2 and wrap), but otherwise
				is working nicely. 
				--to supply multiple commands, just separate them with commas.  nice and easy!
			--gui is more or less updated for MigLayout.  still have the issue of setting the 
				preferred sizes of things, and how I want to handle that, but am leaving as is for 
				now, so can work on putting in a menu bar.
			--menu bar added, but only with "test" menu items and currently no functionality.  will
				need to ask Graeme what values he wants all of these to take.  
				
			for next week:  need to put more into the rule set (player info etc) from Graeme's notes,
				and get the 2nd random event page working like the first.  try implementing some of
				graeme's example events using my classes, and make sure it's doable.  
				can also improve the menu, by making the items actually do something.  
				also look at TODOs in the code for more options			


2015/08/25	a few quick moments in norway...
			colored the non-selectable options in the event phase a different color (needs to be
				changed to something else when i can check what the number means)
			need to change the "phase" system to a "turn type" system...gui shouldn't be hard-coded
				based on the phase, but instead on whether its an event, slider, event-selector, or
				whatever phase.  gamestate should tell it which to display.  
			need to make the stuff all come from rules set, rather than from the gui/gamestate
			ideally should change "time" to "expendable resource" or whatever, so that we're i
				working in the most generic setting outside the ruleset.  in some other game
				it may not be time that they spend each round (and may not spend it each round,
				either! may be that's the level-up part, and most of the game is actually events!)
				
2015/08/27	more norway coding
			changed the displayPhase methods in the main gui to make it a bit more versatile, and
				to make use of the rulesSet methods (ie, now isn't hardcoded to be 4 phases in 
				a row. it asks the rulesSet to tell it what phase to show next, based on the 
				game state)
			moved several methods over to the rulesSet from the game state
			moved miniGui to its own class, rather than a private class in the main gui
			created a function in the rulesset for determining the activities to use
				in the spending phase.  need to change the gui phase to have selectable guis
				that have limited number of options (ie, can only study two magicks at a time)
				but need to do a bit of googling to figure out how to do drop downs

2015/08/31	norway coding 3: at the hotel, so have internet access, so will try to get
				the drop box selectors working as desired, and change the color of 
				the unselectable options 
			--changed the color of unselectable event options to red
			--added combo boxes to spend phase.  still haven't linked them to
				prevent you from doing the same thing twice
				--combo boxes now work like they should, but need to fix the way they are 
					initialized so that repeat options aren't there to cause problems...
					--FIXED!  was rather fiddly, and code is a bit ugly.  probably a ripe for
						improvement at some later point.  but is functional for now.  
				
2015/09/07	back home and working on the game again.  Met with G last week to discuss next steps, and
			top task for me was to get the slider page functioning/doing stuff with the player stats.
			Idea is to just try something for now, and iterate as needed.  So have started putting
			logic into the rulesset function to deal with this... 		
			--have worked just on getting aeromancy working, as an example case.  written a pair
				of methods for implementing a logit model for skill advancement, but need to
				play around with the parameters a bit more to get it balanced as desired.
			tomorrow: generalize the code a bit better, so I don't have to do every skill/magic
				by hand.  have it check to see if you've learned the spell once you reach a
				certain level in skill for magics.
				
2015/09/08	today want to expand on what i did yesterday with the time phase, and get all the 
			current activities handled appropriately.
			--got the stress system working (goes up as square of 'overtime' hours, but reduces
				only linearly, so will mostly want to avoid using it, except in a time crunch
			--all spells handled in same way currently, not sure if this is good or not...
				do we want different schools to behave differently, or all the same?
			--skills currently set up to work same as spells.  again, do we want to make them
				different?
			--jobs currently set up so that each just gives you gold equal to number of hours spent.
				will need to update that to include the specifics of each job.
			--interact:socialize currently not doing anything, as that seems to deal with NPCs, so 
				will likely be trickier to do.
			--moved the submit results call to after the second phase; now back button doesn't
				let them get infinite time
			Probably need to set up the time-costing actions a bit differently, with each type
				having it's own class perhaps?  And the one of the elements of the class being
				a lambda which indicates how to handle time being spent on that action.  Then
				can put all the magic schools, jobs, etc. into an array, and have the code
				grab that array and decide what to do with it, rather than it being hard coded
				into the gui as it is now.  Each of these will also have to have a lambda indicating
				whether or not it is an available action.  Could also put a "max time" attribute,
				so that they don't each have to have the same max time that can be spent on
				them.  
			also want the time spending page to display estimates of the change in stats that
				are likely to occur due to the time spent.  can use same function used to compute
				the change in stats to do this (but will want to use 2 decimal places, most likely?)	
				
2015/09/14	only one day to work on this this week (will get 3 next week).  
				--created a timeSpendOption class, to hold the various schools and skills and such
					that you can spend time on in the time spend phase.  uses lambdas, so is nice
					and generic/abstract.  need to put the actual instances in the rulesSet, but
					original plan was to have ruleSet be purely abstract and not need an implementation.
					Thinking now that I should make an instance of it, and put the instances of
					the timeSpendOptions into that instance on instantiation.  Will need to create
					the instance in main.  
				--doing a whole lot of breaking of the other classes to get them to use the new
					TimeSpendOption class.  May take me a while to things working nicely again...
				--getting things back to how they should be still need to make button to add more
					mini guis of same type, and link them together.  
				--have added an arraylist to game state to hold functions which get called after
					time is spent.  this is so that options not selected in any combobox can
					be referenced (e.g., if an event wants to check if you ever spend less than X
					time on a task, but then you don't pick that task in the combo box, you can't
					put the check in the spendtime function for that activity, because that's only
					called if they spend time on it.  instead, put the check into the function list,
					which gets called after all time is spent).  basically, if you need to do something
					after the time spend phase, make it a function and add it to the array in 
					gameState.  note, each function has a name, which can be used to remove it
					from the list, but doing so within the loop may cause problems, so may want to
					handle that differently? (note, can just overwrite the function with same name
					but empty function?)
					
				for next week:
					--get the mini gui's working as desired if I haven't finished that today
						--needs to only expand if less than 5(?) already there, and if there
							are enough options to fill it up
						--also need to make sure the submit activties and times gets all the 
							miniGuis (including ones created with teh > button)
					--get all the timeOptions filled in in the RulesSets, with functions that
						actually do something (ie, implement the trainining)
						--note, make use of the training times functions I've added that now
							take parameters so different things train a different rates
						--make sure at least some of the items make use of the predicate function,
							and put something in it to test it (eg, lore > 10 before you can
							train necromancy)
					--read G's docs and make sure I've got everything up to date for the stuff
						I'm working on
						
2015/09/21	had some ideas on how to get the guis working.  need to add some state that keeps track
			of the previous item selected, then add that to all other guis, and remove the current
			one when this one makes a selection change.  will work on the list above today, and see
			how far i get.
				-- think i've got the mini guis working properly now (split button, at least, 
					haven't done anything with submitting
				--	have started implementing affects of time spent.  made a wrapper for studying
					to avoid a lot of repeated code.  now need to type in all the stuff G has 
					come up with so far.
				-- 	added all the spell types, skills,  and jobs in G's list to the things 
					you can spend time on each month.  all things of each type currently set
					to do basically the same thing: either give you money equal to time worked,
					or improve the relevant skill/magic by a given s curve.  necromancy also
					causes stress at the moment. 
			Now need to figure out what is the next important thing to work on.  Probably need G 
			provide some insight into what numbers should go into the various time spend options, 
			so can put that aside for a while.  

2015/09/24	today the task is to learn github and get my files onto it.
			--signed up for account.  is £7/month to have private repositories, which i'm willing
				to pay for at this point, since don't want all my stuff public
			--installed the app on computer
			--created a repository on the webpage, and cloned it to the mage guild directory
				(note, just under the work space, so doesn't actually include all my files)
			--copy/pasted my files into the repository on my computer
			--after changes to files, copy them to the repository (note, i'm just copying the src
				file from teh workspace into the git folder for now.  probably want to copy the 
				whole thing over and declare a new workspace or something), then open the app.
				find the repository (mage-guild) on left, will say X uncomitted changes at top.
				click on that, and it should give you a chance to fill in some messages to describe
				the changes.  that gets it ready LOCALLY, but still need to send it to server!
				clikc sync in top right to this...
			--seems to be working like it should, though i can't claim to fully understand it...								

2015/12/12	first day back after harddrive crash and getting lappy fixed.  trying to get git
			working as i'd like.  had to create a new ssh key for the harddrive, since
			lost the old one in the crash (google git creating ssh public key).
			(note, pw id normal long)
			-on github page created a new branch in mage-guild called 'after-crash'
			-navigated into to /src folder of mage guild workspace (is several folders down)
			  right clicked and did a git bash here
			-in the git bash window did git init (this creates a .git folder)
			-git add .   to tell it to track all the files here
			-git commit -m "first commit"   (saves the tracked files, -m attaches message)
			-git clone https://github.com/tycho54/mage-guild.git (links local git to my repo)
			-git remote add origin git@github.com:tycho54/mage-guild.git  (so it knows where 
					to send stuff
			-tried git push origin master, but got an error, b/c missing stuff that's
			 		already in master.
			-git pull   (to grab any files from github it was expecting ot be there)
			-git add . , git commit -m  (to bring it all back up to date)
			-did git push -f origin master (-f is force, which overrides all that other
				stuff that was causing problems)
				
			-moved this file (notes) inside the repository, so it gets saved as well, and 
				did git add notes, git status, git commit -m "added notes", git push origin master
			-git branch working (to create a new branch), git push origin working (to
				make a working branch to keep master safer--use this for now, but can
				merge into master when im happy with the changes)
			
			-next up:  need to put miglayout back into place!	
				-downloaded the jar file
				-right clicked mage guild project (top folder on left)
				-picked buildpath -> add external archive, and pointed it to the file
				all seems to be working fine now.
				
			-now on to getting the magic types put into the rules set...
				-UFF DA!! running into major problems, eclipse not seeing the updated
					files, and instead runs old versions from i-dont-know-where.
				-created a new work space, made new project, copied files over,
					and now things seem to work.  will need to set everything
					back up again for git...
					--right clicked on mage guild (project level) in directory,
						and clicked git bash here
					--git init
					--git add .
					--git commit -m "after copied to new workspace"
					--went to github, created new private repository, called wizGuild
					--git remote add origin git@github.com:tycho54/wizGuild.git
					--git push origin master
					--git branch working
					--git push origin working
					seems like all is okay now.
				
			--Okay, on to magic types for real now!
				--re-rewrote the skills update code to only use a scale, not
					a scale and an offset--since we want skills to start at
					1 effectively (0 would be better, but causes blow ups), 
					offset was determined by the scale.  now only a one parameter
					model, which is nicer.  also hard-coded max value to 100.
				--put in a stress increase for aeromancy based on G's numbers, 
					but will cause way too much as is, so will need to reduce
					significantly
				--put in a chance to learn a magic based on skill level, but may
					be way too hard to learn in current state.  will need to
					check with graeme about what his numbers mean
			
2015/10/13		starting this morning on getting the stress and learn-times
					put into the game.  talked w/ g last night re: stress scores,
					and he basically said to just use the numbers as guides, and
					use my judgement, so can make it up, basically.  also, wants
					learn times to be as stated, +/- about 10.  difficulty can
					be ignored for now.  
				--all magics are now in the system for learning time and stress, 
					following G's notes as guidelines
				--made stress reduce your chance of learning a new magic by the 
					current value (e.g., if you had 50% chance of learning it, 
					and 10 stress, you'd drop to 40% chance)
				--also made stress reduce effective time spent studying by 1/10 
					of the current stress levels (which means stress has bigger
					impact if you're trying to do lots of different things, which
					seems appropriate) (note, only has effect if stress >10,
					because using floor).
				--put a vertical scroll bar on the skill list of the player
					info panel.  will need to separate the items into reasonable
					groups at some point (skills, magics, attributes, etc).
				--fixed a bug where the main panel wasn't resizing properly when
					adding a new mini gui
				--thought that was some good progress, so made a git commit and
					pushed it to github on teh working branch
					
2015/10/27		--added +1 time unit within the study magic code, so that you
					effectively get 1 more time unit studying anything when 
					you do it.  This is to make diversifying more feasible.
				--previously would repeatedly add same flag to character if
				    you learned magic school again.  now checks to see if you
				    already have it before adding it.
				--after much fighting, got it to keep last months time spend
					selections, so that you don't have to do the same stuff
					over and over.
					
2015/11/10		--need to make some progress on the event builder today.  still
					not clear how to do "data as code" in java, but need to get
					a start on the gui at very least.  likely i'll have to either
					create extra constructors for my event and consequences classes,
					or create factory methods?  whatever the case, need to make 
					some progress now.  will worry about next steps once i've got
					a way to collect some basic info from the user.  
				--have created a frame, and put some panels in it, gave it a menu
					bar.  doesn't do anything at this point, but it exists.  
					have created classes for each of the three areas that will
					need to be created for an event: predicate, text, and options.
					Each of these will be fairly involved in and of themselves,
					but all have the same issue--translating player text and 
					clicks into code inside an object.  if I can figure out how
					to do one, should be able to do all of them in similar 
					fashion.  hardest one will be options, since they have several
					components.  text and predicate will be easier, so probably
					want to start with one of them.
					
						-can use .put in a map to match text with values...
							e.g., if they type "x=4", i could use myMap.put(x,4)
							but get the "x" and the "4" from the string...
						-can use an array list of characters, and refer to them
							by index within the text.  need the final version to
							refer to elements of the gamestate.  question is how
							to get them out?  will need to label them within the
							gamestate in a way that lets me get them out (setting
							flags?).  
						-may also want to rethink class definition of events...
							should they be interfaces of functions that get called
							when the game runs them, rather than just having 
							elements in them?  this might make it easier to create 
							them...create as data with a "implement" function,
							which is called at run time to produce the necessary
							fields?  or just use a "getter" that returns text, 
							for example, but use it to generate the text, rather
							than just returning a stored value...
							
2015/11/11	continue work on event builder today.  another idea is just creating
			a pure text file file that is compilable?  
			-added text field for entering event text

2015/11/13	have redone the gui for the event builder.  instead of using a new
			class for each panel, and much just using plane old JPanels and 
			some helper functions to initialize them.  keeps all the related 
			code in a single place, which should hopefully make things easier.
			--need:  validate button on each section, and a label that shows
				validation status (passed, failed, unchecked) for each.  in
				the options section, each option needs this, and needs a button
				to highlight it in the options panel. (note--don't worry about
				doing the validation just yet--just have a dummy function
				that always returns true for now)  
			-if i can get all the info as strings, i could at very least
			write everything to a file, and figure out how to read it in later.
			in a worst case scenario, i coulg give that to G while still trying
			to figure out how to parse the text.

2015/11/24	did some work on train to consequences, so gui is doing much more.
			added a method for storing option state when selecting an option.

	--will need to change the event class--text will need to be a producer<string>
		not a string itself, since it may need to change based on the gamestate
		(e.g., refer to an NPC's name in the text).  Likewise for options text.
		-Related to this, when do should events be instantiated?  When should the 
		objects created by teh event builder be read into memory?  Does the builder
		create event objects that get written to file, or just text files that get
		used when creating the event objects?  is it feasible to keep all the events
		in memory, or do we need to keep them on disk until they're needed?
		--should the private variable for the text be just a string, but the 
			interpretter be part of the function that returns it?  So that mapping
			what G types into the actually shows up on screen is done within the
			event class method, rather than the event builder gui?  Ditto for
			all the other stuff in the Event class?  Still need to validate the
			stuff in the builder, so may make more sense to put it there...also
			probably more efficient to do any necessary mapping there?  
	--for event and option text parsing: break all input down into an arrayList of
		strings, some of which will be marked as code somehow (e.g., w/ ** on each 
		end?).  then need to have the parse be able to read the code parts.  they
		will all be generating Strings, and have a limited set of options to consider.
		Basically need flags (on gamestate and characters), and any methods attached
		to these (getName() etc).  One issue to consider is that flags may not be
		set, so need it to not crash when that is the case.  Might be a good idea
		to start with the text field as the first one w/ G?
		--note: each bit of code in the text can evaluate to a single string, so
			should be comparatively easy to parse (ie, doesn't need to be recursive
			or anything, just a look-up/get call).  
			things we might need:
			-character names
			-character gender terms (his/her/its, him/her/it, etc)
			-character flag values
			-gamestate flag values
			-for small list like this, probably best to just have a one-word 
				identifier to indicate which of these, followed by the text
				string of its name?  
					-might not work if i want to use the name of a character given
						in a flag?  or gender term of character given in a flag...
						so will need to be able to deal with compound code stuff.
				-so perhaps instead just have functions for each of these?  Or a
					single function which takes a value for all possible inputs, 
					and throws out the appropriate result from the combo?								
				-if we have a language where each command is a function that
					takes in a single parameter, and reads entirely left-to-right,
					then we just can write a recursive function that evaluates
					everything to the right of the first word, then uses that as 
					the parameter to for the function that corresponds to the first
					word.  Must be some things that take nothing as a parameter 
					(ie, the last thing on the line).  Would this gives us enough
					flexibility for the text?  Seems like so from the list above,
					but perhaps not if we add more things it needs to be able to do.
					-hisHerIts (and similar functions)
					-npcNamed (string input, character output)
					-pc (no input, returns PC)
					-valueOfCharFlag
					-valueOfStateFlag			
						-if flags contain multiple values, separated by ; then 
						we'd need functions like takeFirstValue and takeSecondValue
						etc, which seems ugly, but avoids the multiple inputs aspect.
						-alternatively, as long as we know the number of elements
						each function requires, we could have it evaluate just the
						next element, then all the rest?  	
				BUT--need to make a single lambda out of the input, not get a single
					string!  So using a bunch of functions like this won't work...
					can we build up a lambda of lambdas?  yes, can still do this.
					(l1, l2) -> {return (l3) -> (l1(l2.execute()))}
					--not sure if that syntax will work, but there is a way to do
						this with lambdas, definitely.  		
				--will want to make some test cases for this, as it's going to be
					very challenging to code up, so likely to have lots of bugs.	
	--check out scanner class--seems to do what i need for simple types...maybe can
		extend it?
	--check out prefuse string parser?
	--nashhorn javascript engine?
	https://github.com/greenjoe/lambdaFromString
			
				
2015/12/08	working on parser for event text today.  hopefully can do a recursive
			method that returns a lambda, with a switch statement on each of
			the eligible words.  	
			--wrote a first version of the parser, but haven't tested/debugged it yet.			
			--done some testing/debugging, and seems to be working
				
2015/12/14	need to expand the parser to take in all the text (not just the code
			subsections), and return a lambda which creates the full event text.  
			--got this working, and did some testing.  handles extra spaces gracefully
				now, both within, and at start/end.  
				
			-next thing is probably making the validate button work in the event
				builder.  how can i check that the string input is a valid expression,
				without first having a game state created?  Will probably need to
				make an exception class, and throw an exception from the parser. if it
				gets to a word it doesn't expect.  
				--note, the string can be valid for the parser and still lead to an
					error if the gamestate doesn't have the appropriate flags set.
					so will still need to be aware of that possibility
				--will largely be the job of the event predicate to avoid problems
					with flags not being set--is there anyway to check that the
					predicate guarantees the other stuff is safe as part of the
					validation process?  (ie, it checks that if the predicate is
					true, then all the stuff in referred to in the text will
					also be able to be called?)
				--also, when i do the predicates, i'll need to be able to check
					for flag values which might not exist (ie, won't be set), and
					when that happens it should return false, not throw an error.
					BUT when validating the predicate i want it to throw an error if
					the expression doesn't parse properly.  
					for predicate parsing will need at least these:
						-flagCalled__isSet (for both characters and state)
						-flagCalled__isEqualTo (ditto)
						-valueOf__isGreaterThan (equal to, less than, etc)
						-getFlagCalled (for characters and state)
						-getValueOf__ (for manythings, but hopefully can use one method)
			--getting the event builder to validate text, and be able to save it is
				probably the step that will start letting G actually make use of
				some of this stuff.  Will eventually probably want buttons for each
				of the words so he doesn't have to remember them, but probably best
				to add the needed functionality before the nice-to-have stuff, so that
				we can start putting it to use/testing it out in a realistic way.  
			--written some code to try to validate the eventText.  running into problem
				in that it doesn't seem to instantiate the function until I call it,
				so will only check for exceptions once I try to make the actual string
				(which means it wants all the gamestate stuff satisfied).  
				--perhaps should make sure a gameState always returns something when
					queried..., even if it's a made-up object just for this purpose?
					--tried throwing exceptions from gameState and Character when
					undefined flags/stats are requested.  But I used the same
					exception type I was using before, so leads to same invalid state
					as if there is a syntax error in the code, which isn't whati want.
					i could throw a different type of exception, but it'll end up
					in a different catch block, which may lead to real errors being
					missed.  probably actually need to return dummy objects (eg, -999
					for bad stats, and "Flag not set" for flags, and a dummy character
					for bad characters?  This will let the eventbuilder do validation
					better, but may make the game less stable in the long run, as
					runtime exceptions won't show up as early, and bugs will be harder
					to track down...
				--created a defaultFlag in gameState and Character, and a defaultNPC
					in gamestate.  also made getStat return -999 when a stat is not
					listed, rather than throwing an error.  now the validator looks
					to be doing what I want, though it will still miss typos on 
					stat and character names and flagnames.				
				
2015/12/21		added some save functionality to the event builder.  will work on
					loading etc. next.  
					
2015/12/22		added load option too.  need to do some file-safety stuff as well,
					ideally creating a specific extention that it opens, and won't
					save any other format.  or at very least it will prompt to make
					sure you want to overwrite something if you try to.	
				pushed latest changes onto github.
		
2015/12/23		made the file chooser only look for files with certain extensions,
				and then made a jar file and sent it to G for feedback. 		
				
2016/01/05		working on bugs in event builder that Graeme found.  
				--fixed issue that it wasn't line wrapping in the text areas
				--adjusted sizes a bit to make things fit better (still not perfect)

				--need to deal w/ fact it reads in thigns by line.  probably need
					to put field demarcations in somehow, instead of assuming each
					line is one bit of the input
				--also need to sort out how best to put line breaks into the 
					event text--hitting return may not be ideal?
				--need "new" option to reset everything
				--NPCnamed doesn't seem to be working as intended...can't take in
					output of a flag call (either from state or from character)
				--needs to give feedback on why its not validating when that happens
					is too hard to track down typos etc.
				--put array thing back in (example of list of players in game
					of poker)
				--need to initialize flags before event starts, so will need a
					new field for making a "consequence" before player has chosen
					any options.  note--may not be needed for every event, so
					needs to free to be blank/empty
					--also good to be able to see which flags have been set here, 
						for easier reference (when making the text)
					--might also be good to place assertions here for flags elsewhere
						so they can be checked more closely in the validation step
						(e.g, flagnames get checked as well as rest of stuff)
				--comparator words (eg "you are ££worseBetter ...££ than £...£ at...")
					so text can give hint as to who's better at something?
					(ideally with multiple levels (slightly better, much better,
					far far better, etc)
				--description of how good someone is at something "formidable" 
					"beginner" (~10 levels?)
					--may need different words for skills, magic, stats
					--three different code words, then, rather than single word
						that does all three
				--add buttons for each word
				--dialog box for delete buttons for options 

2016/01/12	working on list of things from meeting w/ G today. (see above)
			-made a "new" option on the file menu to blank out everything
			-added a confirm pop up for the new option, so you don't accidently
				overwrite your work
			-added a confirm pop up for deleting options, and fixed a bug that 
				occurred when you delete the selected option

2016/02/02	continuing work on list from meeting w/ G.  meeting up later today
				as well.  should i do a bit of work on other systems after event
				text is sorted, or continue on event system?
			-created a message box that shows the error message from the parser,
				so there will be more feedback for the user to act on.
			-fixed problem with NPCnamed
			-changed the way it saves, so now fields are set off between
				<eventPreciate></eventPredicate> and similar tags.  haven't
				coded in the options parts yet. still need to make it read
				in the predicate and text using this format too.
			-changed the way it loads to match the new save format.  still doesn't
				deal w/ options, but predicate and text are working as desired
				
				
			-still need scrollbuttons for text fields on event builder
			
2016/02/08	continuing to work on event builder	
			-java updated, and now eclipse won't run my code...(can't find
				executable for new version of java?).  will need to fix...
				-have ticked a box in project->properties->build to use the new 
					version, but that doens't seem to have fixed things	
				-tried help->update and had it update eclipse...this seems to have
					worked...running as expected now.
			-scroll bars added to predicate and text fields for events
			-scroll bars added to the three options panels as well	

2016/02/09	buncha job stuff today...
			todo:  put tags around whole option section, and after the first tag
					put a single value on the next line which tells how many
					options there are.  do a for loop over that number, within
					each write/read the option components (just like i did for
					the event part).  
				   Need section for event-specific tags
				   Need buttons for the coding options
				   
2016/02/23	back after a bit of a break (jobs hunt and holiday).  need to make some
			progress on the event builder. realized i should probably reorganize 
			the text parser code a bit.  should keep the class itself generic, and
			make it specific on instantiation.  that way can use same class with
			each box in the event editor, and just give each of them a different
			set of lambdas.  Each code word has a name, a lambda, and an error 
			message.  can make a hash table of them at instantiation? 
				-use a factory pattern here.  each type of parser has a method
				for creating it within the textParser class.
			-another idea--when i make buttons for each code word, give them
			tool tips on hovering that show the format expected.

2016/02/29	re-wrote the textparser code to use above ideas...
2016/03/01	put this into the event builder, and it's running, validation isn't
			working properly...
				--need to force it to check that expected types match up, and 
					throw an exception if not.  
				--also need to test that a valid function does what I expect (seems
					possible that the removing of elements of the array could 
					trip things up when it finally gets called.
					
2016/03/07	putting in checks for expected types in codeword instances.  
			--validation step seems to be working as expected now
			still need more words, and to test that the functions returned actually
				give the results expected
2016/03/08	struggling to get functions to return what they should...
			--after much pain, got it running properly.  
			todo:  buttons for each of the words, added in a loop, with hover
				notes working (note, may not be buttons, if there are too many,
				may have to be scrollable list instead?).  
				-fix saving/loading so that all option info is included (check if that's
					already done)
				-need another section in the GUI for pre-setting event flags, etc.
				-put other words into list (for skill levels, etc. might want
					to put them into the character class, and just call them
					from the relevant codewords)

2016/03/15	would like to get this version of the event builder wrapped up a bit, so
			i can send it off to G for him to start using.
			Stuff still needed:
			-new section for event intializing
			-drop down for words in text section (G mentioned the idea of the
				list popping up when he right clicks in teh text field...see if
				that's an option)
			-make sure all sections save/load appropriately, including each
				individual event
			-put the remaining words into the collection (one for an array, others
				for the levels of magic and skills (description words)
			-scroll bar on all the sections (inc. add event box), since not sure
				how well everything will fit on G's screen
			-would be good to github everything once it's working, too.
			
		-got it now saving options data as desired
		-after much fighting, it now loads everything as desired too
		-added scrollbar to options section
		-added new text section for init section
		-updated load,save, new to include the new section
		
		TODO for next time:  get the drop-down list of words put into the
							event text panel, and add some more words
			
2016/03/21	need to get the codewords into a dropdown list, and ideally a popupmenu
			on a right click done so i can send it over to G today.  if time,
			add some more words as well.
			-put in combobox menu for code word, did some reformatting, and it 
				seems to be working as desired
			-put in another check in validation, to make sure each section of 
				code ulitmately returns a string
			-fixed bug in validator when text started with code
			
			
			

ISSUES:		-Need to settle on a screen size/resolution and/or sort out how to make it resize
				as we want it to.
			-NPCs and all the world other than the PC
			-time-free actions (check out book, trade, etc)
			-extra info pages and menu bar options
			-servants (golems, imps, etc.)
			-item creation and use
			-Event creator GUI for G to use
			-spell combat?
			-system for determining which "random" events occur each month
